# BigMac-Energy-Calculator
Ever wonder how many Big Macs worth of energy the Hoover Dam generates? Well, now you have an Killowatt to Big Mac calculator.

##Context from ChatGP
To convert the amount of energy generated by the Hoover Dam into an equivalent number of Big Macs per hour, we need to make a few assumptions and calculations.

First, let's gather some information:

1. The Hoover Dam's average annual electricity generation is approximately 4.2 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) [source: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation].

2. The calorie content of a Big Mac is approximately 563 kilocalories (kcal) [source: McDonald's].

Now, let's calculate the conversion:

1. Convert kilowatt-hours (kWh) to kilocalories (kcal):
   - 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 860 kilocalories (kcal)

   Therefore, the Hoover Dam generates:
   - 4.2 billion kWh * 860 kcal/kWh = 3.612 billion kilocalories (kcal) per year

2. Convert kilocalories (kcal) to Big Macs:
   - 1 Big Mac = 563 kilocalories (kcal)

   Therefore, the Hoover Dam's energy generation is equivalent to:
   - 3.612 billion kcal / 563 kcal = approximately 6,415,498 Big Macs per year

3. Convert to Big Macs per hour:
   - Assuming a year consists of 8,760 hours (365 days * 24 hours), we can calculate the rate per hour:

   - 6,415,498 Big Macs / 8,760 hours â‰ˆ 732 Big Macs per hour (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Thus, the amount of energy generated by the Hoover Dam is approximately equivalent to 732 Big Macs per hour, based on the calorie content of a Big Mac.
